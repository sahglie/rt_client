When trying to use the rt-client gem with ruby 1.9.3 I quickly discovered that there were some dependencies that weren't 1.9.3 compatible.

This is a fork of the rt-client gem for my own purposes.  Permission has been obtained from Tom Lahti to  use code from rt-client.  Most of the original code has been removed, and the file structure has been reorganized.  Only the functionality that I currently need has been retained and/or updated.

Additional functionality may be added as needed or as time permits.
